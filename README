PURPOSE:
"ReDBox is a metadata registry application for describing research data.
The Mint is an name-authority and vocabulary service that complements ReDBox."
See http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/.  The purpose of this script is to:
- retrieve the specified (person or project) CSV file from a URL
- ingest (or harvest or load) the file into the appropriate Mint data source

NOTES:
- Has been tested & designed for use on ReDBox & Mint dev-handle build.
  (It should also work for other ReDBox-Mint variants.)

APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT:
Read the INSTALL file.

INSTALLATION:
Read the INSTALL file.

FEATURES:
- Allows loading of person or project metadata into Mint.
- Allows loading of all records in the file or an incremental load of new
  or updated records since the last load.
- Script is suitable to be run within a unix cron environment.
- Produces output suitable for redirecting to a log file.
- Will not attempt to ingest metadata if Mint is not running.

TODO:
- Consider not performing a full-load unless CSV file has changed.
