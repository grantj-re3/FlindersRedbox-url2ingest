=========================

v1.0
----
Initial version. Is able to load full CSV file or incremental changes since
the last load into the specified Mint data source.

v1.1
----
A regular expression filter is now always applied via configuration files:
- etc/include_filter_people.conf
- etc/include_filter_project.conf

v1.2
----
Rewritten so that incremental loads do not only notice changes in the CSV
file, but they also notice changes resulting from alteration of the
etc/include_filter_*.conf files.

High level algorithm:
- Download CSV file
- Apply filter to downloaded-CSV file
- If full-load:
  * ingest downloaded-CSV file into Mint
- If incremental-load:
  * compare filtered-CSV with previous successfully loaded
    filtered-CSV to determine new or updated (incremental) records.
  * ingest incremental-CSV file into Mint
- Save downloaded-CSV to history directory in case the next
  load is an incremental one. Save other CSV files if required.
