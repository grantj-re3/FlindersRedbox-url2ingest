=========================

v1.0
----
Initial version. Is able to load full CSV file or incremental changes since
the last load into the specified Mint data source.

v1.1
----
A regular expression filter is now always applied via configuration files:
- etc/include_filter_people.conf
- etc/include_filter_project.conf

v1.2
----
Rewritten so that incremental loads do not only notice changes in the CSV
file, but they also notice changes resulting from alteration of the
etc/include_filter_*.conf files.

High level algorithm:
- Download CSV file
- Apply filter to downloaded-CSV file
- If full-load:
  * ingest filtered-CSV file into Mint
- If incremental-load:
  * compare filtered-CSV with previous successfully loaded
    filtered-CSV to determine new or updated (incremental) records.
  * ingest incremental-CSV file into Mint
- If loading of CSV into Mint was successful, save filtered-CSV to
  history directory in case the next load is an incremental one. Save
  other CSV files if required.

v1.3
----
The Mint CSV-load script tf_harvest.sh does not return an error status so
this script attempts to guess the error status by looking inside the
$TF_HARVEST_LOG.  However for DEBUG logging, $TF_HARVEST_LOG includes title,
description & other CSV fields which may include words or substrings such as
"error" or "fail" or "exception" which we may use to guess the error status.
Hence $TF_HARVEST_LOG_EXCLUDE_REGEX (new in v1.3) allows us to exclude certain
lines from $TF_HARVEST_LOG *before* searching for error phrases.

The error status is particularly important for incremental loading in order to
implement the algorithm "load new/updated records since last successful load".
