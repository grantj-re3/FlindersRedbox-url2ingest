SEQUENCE OF EVENTS FOR PEOPLE METADATA:

- Download CSV
- Include only records which match regexs given in include_filter_people.conf
- Exclude only records which match regexs given in exclude_filter_people.conf
- Add CSV records listed in add_people.csv


NOTES:
- include_filter_people.conf requires a regex to include the header line and
  another (or the same) regex to include metadata lines
- if you do not wish exclude_filter_people.conf to exclude any lines then
  you will need to add a regex which cannot match any line eg. "a^"
- add_people.csv must have exactly the same fields in exactly the same
  order as the downloaded CSV file
- add_people.csv can include a header line but it is optional and is
  not used (since the metadata CSV lines are simply appended to the
  filtered CSV file - which does have a header line)


SEQUENCE OF EVENTS FOR PROJECTS METADATA:

Identical to sequence for people metadata but with files:
- include_filter_project.conf instead of include_filter_people.conf
- exclude_filter_project.conf instead of exclude_filter_people.conf
- add_projects.csv instead of add_people.csv
